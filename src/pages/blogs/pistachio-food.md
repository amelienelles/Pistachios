Through years of experience with Iranian pistachios, the Iranian people have
developed numerous ways of enhancing dishes with tasty pistachios. Ice cream and
meat are two of the most prominent examples of how pistachios can make a great
product even better. Even animal food is enriched with healthy pistachio shells
to increase the quality of animal-derived food.
