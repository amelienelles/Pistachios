Speaking of pistachio shells, we can assure itâ€™s not only the kernel that is of
high quality. The shells of our pistachios are full of minerals and vitamins,
which are being used for soil fertilization, natural plant protection as well as
jewelry and mosaics. Even environmental pollution (caused from toxic mercury)
can be addressed with pistachio shells.
